Week 1, 12th March, 1st team meeting.
Subjects: 
1.Demonstrate reading of data from file 
2.outline of main program, including major classes, sketch of screens

Reading data:
- Processing provides both loadBytes and loadStrings commands. The split method should also be helpful.
- A simple(although not particularly efficient)solution would be to define a DataPoint class which represents a single flight. 
  There would be one instance of the class for each entry in the input file.
- You may wish to store the data in a format which is more efficient to access.

Reposibility:
- Neil & Aryan: data reading, the function should read in the csv file.
- Daniel & Muireann & Oliver & Zicheng: the Datapoint class;

Question:
1. how to pull data from the .csv file by Oliver
- solved by Aryan.
